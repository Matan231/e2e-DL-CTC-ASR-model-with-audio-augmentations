**Deep Audio-ASR: End-to-End Deep Learning for Automatic Speech Recognition on a Limited Dataset.
using a small dataset to train the model from scratch, without relying on pre-trained audio encoders. Exploring various augmentations, network architectures, and losses, culminating in a final model that employs a CTC-based encoder-decoder architecture with a beam search and a 4-gram LLM decoder.**
